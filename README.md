## Welcome to my humble Website
Thanks for stopping by! You might be in interested in my profile and these topics / projects.

## About me:

I studied computer science in Hamburg (BSc) and Kiel (MSc) focusing on functional, object-oriented and multi-paradigm programming languages. You may contact me using ```brox dot p at web dot de``` (replacing ```dot -> .``` and ```at -> @```).

Thinking about the "best" way to solve programming tasks has always fascinated me. I highly appreciate declarative object-oriented approaches like [Xtend](http://www.eclipse.org/xtend).

Please also check out my programming dedicated Blog [Xtendasy](http://xtendasy.tumblr.com) for articles.

Guitar music is one of my beloved topics and [I play guitar myself](https://soundcloud.com/broxp).

I also enjoy improvisation theatre being an improv actor myself in a small group in Kiel. Radio plays are also a form of art I highly appreciate.

Moreover, I play card/board games, as well as video games (both of which I like to create myself from time to time).

## Card games

[The Faction Conflict](factions.md) is a scifi-themed trading card game.

[MtgGen](mtggen.md) is a random magic card generator.

## .NET Programs

[GraphTool](graphtool.md) is an editor written in C# using WPF for graph-like structures with SVG export.
