## Welcome to my humble Website

Thanks for stopping by! You might be in interested in my profile and these topics / projects.

## About me

I studied computer science in Hamburg (BSc) and Kiel (MSc) focusing on functional, object-oriented and multi-paradigm programming languages. You may contact me using ```brox dot p at web dot de``` (replacing ```dot -> .``` and ```at -> @```).

Thinking about the "best" way to solve programming tasks has always fascinated me. I highly appreciate declarative object-oriented approaches like [Xtend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xtend).

Please also check out my programming dedicated Blog [Xtendasy](http://xtendasy.tumblr.com) for articles.

Guitar music is one of my beloved topics and [I play guitar myself](https://soundcloud.com/broxp).

I also enjoy improvisation theatre being an improv actor myself in a small group in Kiel. Radio plays are also a form of art I highly appreciate.

Moreover, I play card/board games, as well as video games (both of which I like to create myself from time to time).
